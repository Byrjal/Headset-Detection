# Headset-Detection

This project takes .csv data files from scattering parameters measured from the headset and utilises different machine learning models to detect or differentiate between the two states: the user wearing the headset or not (e.g. placed on a table).
Real-world use cases for implementing the detection in a headset can be vast. Some are:
- Pause/resume calls depending on whether the headset is on the head.
- It can reduce call misses.
- Auto-play/pause music or videos when user wears or removes the headset.
- Trigger auto power-off to conserve battery.
